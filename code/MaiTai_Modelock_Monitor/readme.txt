This is simple code for monitoring the Modelock status of a MaiTai laser and stopping Orchestrator from acquiring data. 

The modelock_alerter GUI is very simple. It is only capable of opening and closing the shutter, monitoring modelock status, 
an informing Orchestrator when to stop. We have a more elaborate solution in the works, but this one is functional enough
for most purposes. 

For set up instructions see the doc text in modelock_alerter.m
