Images should be:

* Clear and in focus. 
* Of a reasonable size (e.g. roughly 1000 pixels across). Not over-sized and not tiny.
* Compressed fairly heavily to save space. e.g. 50% JPG compression in Gimp.
* Use descriptive file names that start with your Lab's initials. Avoid spaces or weird characters.
