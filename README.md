This repository is for sharing information on running and improving the TissueVision microscopy system.
It contains a simple GUI for pausing acquisition if the laser loses modelock. There are Latex documents
containing protocols for embedding samples and for running the TissueVision microscope. 
Links to the PDFs of the protocols are on the [Releases page](https://github.com/BaselLaserMouse/TissueVisionMods/releases)

### The Wiki
In addition there is a bunch of information on protocols and hardware modifications on [the wiki](https://github.com/BaselLaserMouse/TissueVisionMods/wiki).

### Stitching
We have also shared [StitchIt](https://github.com/BaselLaserMouse/StitchIt), which is our software pipeline for image assembly.
