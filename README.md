# TissueVision Mods and Protocols

This repository is for sharing information on running and improving the TissueVision microscopy system.
It contains a simple GUI for pausing acquisition if the laser loses modelock. There are Latex documents
containing protocols for embedding samples and for running the TissueVision microscope. These are supplied
as PDFs here:

- [Embedding a sample in agarose for imaging with the TissueVision](https://github.com/BaselLaserMouse/TissueVisionMods/files/598068/CovalentAgaroseEmbedding.pdf)
- [System usage manual](https://github.com/BaselLaserMouse/TissueVisionMods/files/593288/SystemUsageManual.pdf)

### The Wiki
In addition there is a bunch of information on protocols and hardware modifications on [the wiki](https://github.com/BaselLaserMouse/TissueVisionMods/wiki).
